## Cribbage

I had two main goals for this project:
- Learn how to use Godot and go through the entire video game development cycle
- Develop opponent logic driven by statistics to see how well it performs

This is my first project to teach myself how to learn Godot.  To that end, I mostly wanted to get a better understanding of Godot terminology and processes and how everything flows.  When looking at the code for
this project, you can see how there are several things jammed together that shouldn't be and how variables gradually stopped conforming to Godot naming conventions.

Instead of spending an excessive amount of time refactoring this project, I'm just going to take what I've learned from here and apply it to the next project.
